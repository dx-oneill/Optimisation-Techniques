# Coordinate Search and Batch Gradient Descent (Python)

This mini project implements two fundamental optimisation techniques from numerical methods:

- **Coordinate Search** – a basic directional search method
- **Batch Gradient Descent** – applied to linear regression with custom batch size and learning rate

These were originally developed as part of a machine learning coursework (MA308) at Swansea University.
